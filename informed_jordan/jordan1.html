        <p class="one-target-p">The Air Jordan 1 High boasts a rich history, intertwined with the legendary career of Michael Jordan. Designed by Peter Moore in 1984, the shoe was initially met with resistance from the NBA for its bold black and red colorway, which supposedly violated uniform regulations (earning it the nickname "Banned"). However, this controversy only fueled its popularity.  Worn by a young Michael Jordan during his rookie season, the Air Jordan 1 High transcended the basketball court, becoming a cultural icon and launching a billion-dollar brand.  Over the years, the shoe has seen countless colorways and collaborations, solidifying its place as a timeless classic and a coveted symbol of athletic excellence and street style.</p>
